## 💡 Conceptual Flow  

### 1️⃣ User & System Workflow

- **Admin**: Approves lawyers, manages user activity, handles abuse/reports.

### 2️⃣ AI Assistant & Prompting (Optional Integration)  
While the platform focuses on **lawyer–client matching**, AI features can extend its functionality:  
- **Zero-Shot Prompting**: “How do I file an FIR?” → AI gives step-by-step guidance.  
- **Few-Shot Prompting**: Provide legal Q&A examples for structured AI replies.  
- **Dynamic Prompting**: Tailor responses based on domain (criminal, family, corporate).  
- **Structured Output**: Deliver legal steps in JSON or formatted output.  
- **Function Calling**: AI can trigger backend tools (e.g., stamp duty calculator).

### 3️⃣ Similarity Search (RAG + Recommendations)  
- Techniques: **Cosine Similarity, Dot Product, L2 Distance** to match legal queries with lawyer expertise.  
- **Vector Database (FAISS / Pinecone)**: Stores embeddings of legal problems for fast retrieval & recommendations.

### 4️⃣ Evaluation Pipeline  
Custom judge prompts validate AI/legal responses by ensuring:  
- ✅ Accuracy  
- ✅ Relevance to Indian law  
- ✅ No hallucinations  

A testing layer ensures reliable answers to queries like *“What does CrPC 154 mean?”*.
